  <h1>Jesus the Master Discipler</h1>
  <p>Jesus spoke to the crowd more as means of his training of the apostles and other future evangelist (such as the seventy-two) than to convert the crowd. Jesus was truly interested in the sharing God with those multitudes, but he wasn't naive  enough to suppose that teaching those large groups was going to really do the job of changing their lives. He realized that a more individualized approach was necessary.</p>
  <p>The multitudes met him with joyful acclamation at the triumphal entry and a few days later were yelling "Crucify Him!". Their real understanding of him and his mission was almost none. It was going to take a more personalized approach if they were to understand the real Jesus.</p>
  <p>After his ascension back to heaven, he left only one hundred twenty in Jerusalem and about five hundred in Galilee who were still faithful followers.</p>
  <p>The masses were not "converted" by the greatest sermon in the world. Jesus had a better way and the only way.</p>
  <p>Humans are not good at learning abstract truth in the absence of a physical demonstration. The coming of Jesus on earth was in helping men to understand God.</p>
  <p>Most of what we learn in life is learned by on-the-job-training. We watched big brother tie his shoes and then we immitate him.</p>
  <p>Becoming a carpenter is a process. A journeyman repeatedly shows a apprentice how to do carpentry.</p><p>Just about everything we learn in the early years of our lives,like most of what we learn in the later years is immitating someone. It is the fastest and the easiest way to learn.</p>
