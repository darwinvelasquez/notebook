  <h1>Christianity is a Taught Religion</h1>
  <p>No one can become a disciple of Jesus without first being taught. No one can mature as a disciple without continuing to be taught. The way of teaching is important.</p>
  <p>How can we become more and more like Jesus?</p>
  <p>We need other people (committed disciples) in teaching us to obey all things Jesus commanded. The way Jesus originally trained the twelve to obey.<em> Matthew 28:19-20</em></p> 
  <p>It requires mentoring relationship also known as discipling relationship and it will be effective only if we are willing to cooperate and have the humility to learn from others.</p>
