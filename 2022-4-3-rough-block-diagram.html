  <h1>Rough Block Diagram</h1>
  <p>Before you start programming, you need to think about how the hardware will be connected. Use a rough block diagram to help you see all the parts that you need and to think through how they should be connected. Eventually, you'll need to know exactly how to connect things, but in the block diagram you just use one line to symbolize some kind of connection.</p>
