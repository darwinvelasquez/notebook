  <h1>The Master Plan of Evangelism</h1>
  <p>The Israelites in the old testament could not gain a complete understanding of God simply from reading the law. They needed to see a flesh and blood God. <em>in the form of Jesus</em></p>
  <p>Ephesians 1: 22-23</p>
  <p>The church is described as the fullness of Christ. People today cannot undestand Christ simply from reading the new testament. We need to see a flesh and blood Jesus in the form of his body, the church of his disciples.</p>
  <p>Biblical evidence shows that there can be no "loner" Christian.</p>
  <p>We play an essential role in each other's life. The gospel cannot be spread effectively without the human demonstration at the heart of it, nor can those who accept it be brought to maturity without those relationship.<em>Matthew 28:19-20</em></p>
