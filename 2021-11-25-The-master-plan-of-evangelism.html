  <h1>The Master Plan of Evangelism</h1>
  <p>The Israelites in the old testament could not gain a complete understanding of God simply from reading the law. They needed to see a flesh and blood God. <em>in the form of Jesus</em></p>
  <p>Ephesians 1: 22-23</p>
  <p>The church is described as the fullness of Christ. People today cannot undestand Christ simply from reading the new testament. We need to see a flesh and blood Jesus in the form of his body, the church of his disciples.</p>
  <p>Biblical evidence shows that there can be no "loner" Christian.</p>
  <p>We play an essential role in each other's life. The gospel cannot be spread effectively without the human demonstration at the heart of it, nor can those who accept it be brought to maturity without those relationship.<em>Matthew 28:19-20</em></p>
  <p>God didn't choose to drop leather-bound, gold edges bibles from heaven. He knew that the gospel had to be communicated by humans, because those receiving the message had to see it in writing and in lives. Enter King Jesus! and enter true disciples of Jesus.</p>
  <p>Most sinners will never read a bible until they see it lived out in a person, and they will never see it a person until that person is getting discipled according to the direction in the bible.</p>
  <p><strong>Discipleship</strong> when put in practice, lives change radically and other are drawn to that magnet of visible change.</p>
  <p>Discipling was the plan of Jesus for the salvation of the world. Jesus poured his life into men, especially the twelve and when he returned to heaven, he left them toevangelize the world. They effectively carried out his mission because they followed the same plan of pouring their lives into the lives of others, who repeated the same process over and over.</p>
  <p>Christ purpose was never to personally convert the masses.</p>
  <p>For in physical body he was limited to one place at one time.</p>
  <p>This answer the question...If Jesus had lived on earth longer will he be able to accomplished more? maybe but the bible mentioned that unles Jesus ascended to heaven the promised Holy Spirit won't be able to do his work</p>
  <p>However through the work of the Holy Spirit and through his church Jesus could be everywhere at once. The masses are converted one by one</p>
  <p>As we share our faith, disciples all over the world were doing the same.</p>
  <h2>The Basics of His plan</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><p><strong>First</strong> He called men to follow him <em>Mark 1:14-18</em>. They undestood the commitment well enough to leave their personal priorities behind them and to accept Jesus' priorities. To follow Jesus is a lifetime commitment with no limitation. Responding to His call is neither for the faint hearted nor for those with shallow commitment. It will forever be complete surrender of our lives to Jesus.</p></li>
    <li><p><strong>Second</strong> He kept men with him in onder to train them and later send them out to share his message <em>Mark 3:11</em>. He demonstrated all aspects of the spiritual life from prayer to preaching. His training program was no seminary of academic intellectualism. <em>It was following his steps as he loved, served and taught men.</em></p></li>
  </ul>
