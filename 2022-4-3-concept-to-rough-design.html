  <h1>Concept to Rough Design</h1>
  <p>As the project progresses from concept to rough design to testing of the hardware, we keep having having to go back and make changes in something we did earlier, so that everything will work together properly. We dont know a single engineer who start with a blank piece of paper, design a whole project from start to finish, which then works exactly as planned, without ever having to go back and change anything.</p>
  <p>All of the preceding is true for hardware as well as software.</p>
  <p>The point here is that even if you are a beginner, you are ready to design projects, start with what you know, and slowly add features, one new idea or parts at a time. Don't be afraid to explore intriguing ideas that have no immediate use.</p>
  <p>When ever I hear of an electronic part or programming concept or trick that seems interesting, I try it out even if I don't have a use for it right away. This knowledge then becomes another tool in my toolkit. If you get stuck or don't know something, remember that even professinal engineers have to learn new things all the time.</p>
