    <ul>
      <li>The current going through an Arduino i/o pin should be limited to 20 milliamps.</li>
      <li><p>Using MOSFET: MOSFET means metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor. It is a special type of transistor that operates on the field effect principle. This means that electricity will flow through a piece of semiconductor material (between the drain and source pins) when a voltage is applied to the gate pin. As the gate is insulated from the rest through a layer of metal oxide, no current flows from arduino into the MOSFET, making it very simple to interface. MOSFET are ideal for switching on and off large loads at high frequency like the IRF520. Use 1N4007 rectifier diode to protect the MOSFET.</p> </li>
